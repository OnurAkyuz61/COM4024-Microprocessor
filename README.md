# COM4024 - Microprocessor Course Examples

This repository contains my personal example code for the COM4024 Microprocessor course. These examples are my own work and demonstrate various concepts related to microprocessor programming, including bit manipulation, memory access, pointer usage, and hardware interaction.

## Contents

The repository includes both C and Assembly language examples:

### C Examples
- Bit manipulation and bitwise operations
- Pointer usage and memory access
- Volatile variables and shift operations
- LED control examples
- Type conversions and overflow demonstrations
- String operations and formatting

### Assembly Examples
- Basic arithmetic operations
- LED control
- Button input handling
- Seven-segment display control
- Stack operations (push/pop)
- Branching and comparison operations

## Development Environments

### CPUlator

Many of these examples can be tested using the CPUlator online ARM simulator. CPUlator provides a virtual environment for testing ARM assembly and C code with simulated hardware components.

### Keil µVision

These examples are designed to work with Keil µVision IDE, which is widely used for ARM microcontroller development. Keil µVision provides a complete development environment including:

- Code editor
- Compiler
- Debugger
- Device simulation

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository
2. For CPUlator:
   - Copy the desired example code
   - Paste it into the CPUlator editor
   - Configure for the appropriate ARM processor
   - Compile and run

3. For Keil µVision:
   - Open Keil µVision
   - Create a new project or open an existing one
   - Add the desired example file to your project
   - Configure for your target microcontroller
   - Build and flash to your device (or use the simulator)
